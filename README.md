<p align="center"> We are The Coven Collective; a diagnosed 18+ system. We have been playing PonyTown since 2018. We won't give out our rentry to anyone from here anymore due to safety reasons and having had it used by individuals to try to stalk us or manipulate us. Get to actually know us through conversation; not a website. We often end up AFKing or just being on to people watch and sit with our partner system or our friends. Feel free to interact freely with anyone so long as you listen to the below DNI criteria list for our own personal comfort. We apologize if we don't remember interactions, names or the like given the memory issues that come with a dissociative disorder and may need reminders of things from time to time if we end up interacting more than once or twice. A final note is please refrain from copying or taking inspiration from ANY of our  skins! These are all very personal to those who's skins they are and should be treated with the respect of acknowledging such.

</p>

- Proshippers; you know what we mean by this and won't waste the time to argue about it. Get help.
  
- If you plan on being weird to any of our fictives; fictives aren't their source, even if they have "source memories" or similar behaviors.
  
- Anyone under the age of 18; we don't enjoy talking to or being near minors who sneak onto the 18+ server. Go back to PG.

- Anyone who indulges in or thinks that loli or shota is acceptable and gives the excuse that they aren't real people so it doesn't have a sway on actual reality. we refuse to sit and argue about this bullet point; we have our reasonings and would rather you hide us than even try to talk about this topic.

- Anyone who is Racist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Ableist, An Ace / Aro denier or just generally bigoted in their personal beliefs. We prefer to only befriend people who are open-minded and don't like people who foster hate for others based on their own identity.

- Anyone who wants to try to preach religion on this hellscape of a site. We don't hate on any sort of religion and are very accepting, however, we have no interest in having ANY religion shoved down our throat. If you want to do that, go do that somewhere else.

- If you think jokes about rape are funny or make jokes about threatening to touch people. You are genuinely gross and it's really uncomfortable; stay the hell away from us if you do.

- "Endogenic" supporters / believers who think that dissociative disorders can be present in someone who hasn't experienced any trauma or those who romanticize mental disorders in general. This disorder sucks and we only have our status openly listed so people can be mindful of it when interacting with us; it isn't fun or quirky.

<p align="Center">  That's basically our boundaries summed up; just be a good person and we will have no issues at all and would be ok with socializing! Do feel free to talk with us or ask to sit with us if you feel inclined. Depending on fronter, we may be ok with cuddling or allowing you to hide behind us on PonyTown, just make sure to ask if you're going to do so first! We look forward to interacting with you and thank you for being respectful of our boundaries for who we are willing to hang out with and taking time to read them.
