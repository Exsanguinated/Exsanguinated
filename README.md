<p align="center"> We are The Coven Collective; a diagnosed 18+ system. We have been playing PonyTown since 2018 and often end up AFKing or just being on to people watch and sit with our partner system or friends. Feel free to interact freely with anyone so long as you listen to DNI criteria list for our own personal comfort. We apologize if we don't remember interactions, names or the like given the memory issues that come with a dissociative disorder and may need reminders of things from time to time if we end up interacting more than once or twice. A final note is please refrain from copying or taking inspiration from ANY of our  skins! These are all very personal to those who's skins they are and should be treated with the respect of acknowledging such.

-  We use weed medicinally for chronic pain and usually play games or ponytown while high; if this bothers you for some reason, don't bother engaging.

-  Please don't vent to us if we aren't already close or haven't offered to let you vent! It's genuinely stressful and tiring and will end up with you being temp-muted.

-  We often struggle with reaching out first and apologize in advance; our anxiety genuinely gets so overwhelming at times that the solution is to just shut down.

-  There are times where we will be blurry and not have a firm grasp on anything; we ask that you be patient and refrain from being too hard on us if we struggle to respond in chat.

-  Feel free to ask to cuddle or hide with us if wanted and the response will depend on the current fronter(s), PLEASE do be respectful though and don't make a scene if you are declined.

- Proshippers; you know what we mean by this and won't waste the time to argue about it. Get help.
  
- If you plan on being weird to any of our fictives; fictives aren't their source, even if they have "source memories" or similar behaviors.
  
- Anyone under the age of 18; we don't enjoy talking to or being near minors who sneak onto the 18+ server. Go back to PG.

- Anyone who indulges in or thinks that loli or shota is acceptable and gives the excuse that they aren't real people so it doesn't have a sway on actual reality. we refuse to sit and argue about this bullet point; we have our reasonings and would rather you hide us than even try to talk about this topic.

- Anyone who is Racist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Ableist, An Ace / Aro denier or just generally bigoted in their personal beliefs. We prefer to only befriend people who are open-minded and don't like people who foster hate for others based on their own identity.

- If you think jokes about rape are funny or make jokes about threatening to touch people. You are genuinely gross and it's really uncomfortable; stay the hell away from us if you do.

- "Endogenic" supporters / believers who think that dissociative disorders can be present in someone who hasn't experienced any trauma or those who romanticize mental disorders in general. This disorder sucks and we only have our status openly listed so people can be mindful of it when interacting with us; it isn't fun or quirky.
